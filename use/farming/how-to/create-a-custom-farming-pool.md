# Create a custom farming pool

Thanks to the FlatQube functionality, you can create your own pools: choose a farming token, a reward, its distribution rate, etc. \
You can also create a farming pool with a [custom pair](../../pairs/how-to/create-new-pair.md).

## New farming

To create a farming pool, go to the **Farming** section and select **Create farming pool** at the top right of the page.

In the page that opens, you need to fill in some fields:

1. First, copy the root address of the token that will be used for farming (LP token) and paste this address into the **Farm token root** line.
2. If necessary, check the box next to **Active token boost**. \
   Enter the maximum token lock period as well as the maximum boost ratio.
3. The standard reward token is QUBE, but you can add any other token as a reward. \
   To do this, click **Add reward token** at the bottom left of the page, enter the root address of the token, the vesting period and the vesting ratio.
4. Click **Create pool** and confirm the transaction in the Ever Wallet window that opens.

Congratulations, you have created your own farming pool! \
You can manage this pool on its page. You can find it in the list of favorite pools in the Farming section (do not forget to set the "With low balance" filter).
