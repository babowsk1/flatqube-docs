# Get a boost

You can increase the amount of rewards for farming using **Boosted Farming:**

1. Go to the Farming pools section and select the remote control you need.
2. Pay attention to the section on the right side of this pool - there you can replenish the pool with liquidity.
3. Enter the number of LP tokens that you want to deposit into this pool and select the token locking period. The longer the tokens remain locked, the greater the multiplier your farming speed.
4. Click Deposit to start farming and confirm the transaction in the Ever Wallet window that opens.
