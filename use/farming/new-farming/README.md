# New farming

Welcome to the updated farming section.&#x20;

The [old farming](../old-farming/) will continue to work, however, only those pools that do not participate in the FlatQube DAO voting will work.&#x20;

You can use the old farming by visiting the appropriate section:

2. Gauges (new farming pools)
3. [Reward distribution speed change](../concepts/reward-distribution.md)
4. Updated [farming pool creation form](broken-reference)
