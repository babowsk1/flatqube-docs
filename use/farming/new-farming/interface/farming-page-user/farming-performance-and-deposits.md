# Farming performance and deposits

### Your farming performance

This block displays information about your locked funds in the pool:

Balance displays:

* The dollar equivalent of your stake (current and past).
* Amount of tokens that make up your LP at the moment. \
  This number changes depending on the ratio of the prices of these tokens to each other.
* Number of locked LP tokens.
* Share in the farming pool reflects the percentage of your farming LPs from the total number locked in this farming pool. \
  At the same time, it is a percentage of the total reward that you will receive at any given time.

* **Available reward** - the amount of earned reward, which you can withdraw at the moment.
* **Locked reward** - the amount of reward locked in the [vesting](../../../concepts/vesting.md). \
  Part of this reward is permanently unlocked and goes to Available reward.

The right side contains APR information and a balance management window:

* **Current APR** is the current annual return from your stake.
* **Default APR** is the annual yield of the pool without taking into account the boosts.
* **Boost with LP lock** - the percentage of APR that is given by locking LP tokens for a certain period of time.
* **Boost with QUBE** - the percentage of APR which is given by locking QUBE. Read more on the page at [this link](../../../../dao/how-to/get-a-boost.md).

Clicking on **Deposit LP** tokens will open a window for [depositing ](../../how-to/deposit-withdraw-farm-tokens.md)LP tokens into the pool.&#x20;

Clicking on **Withdraw LP token** will open a window for [withdrawing ](../../how-to/deposit-withdraw-farm-tokens.md)funds from the pool.
