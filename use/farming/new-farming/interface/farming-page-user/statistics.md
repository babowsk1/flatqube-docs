# Statistics

This block displays the total statistics of the farming pool:

* **TVL** - the total number of tokens blocked in the pool and their dollar equivalent.
* **APR, min./APR, max.** is a measure of the annual yield of that pool. \
  **Min. APR** is the minimum profit that a user receives for locking their LP tokens for the shortest period possible. \
  **Max. APR** is the profitability for the maximum boost coefficient for LP tokens and the boost for locking QUBE tokens.
* **Reward balance** - the number of tokens, distributed as a reward throughout the farming period.
* **Farming speed, sec** - the number of tokens per second, evenly distributed among the stakeholders as a reward.

Next to it is a graph reflecting the pool statistics. \
Note that you can change the display options between TVL, Min. and Max. APR, and between days and hours.
