# Farming pools

By going to the [**Farming** ](../../concepts/yield-farming.md)section, you will find yourself on a page with a list of currently available Farming pools.\
If you previously [added liquidity](../../old-farming/how-to/deposit-farm-tokens.md) to one of the farming pools, then this pool will be displayed in the Favorite pools block.

This page also displays various columns with farm pool information:

* **Farm pool** - the [LP tokens](../../../pools/how-to/add-liquidity.md) of this particular liquidity pool must be locked in the Farming pool in order to start receiving a reward.
* **Reward** is the tokens that are awarded as a [reward for farming](../../concepts/reward-token.md) in this pool.
* **TVL** is the total dollar amount of tokens locked in this farming pool.
*   **APR, min./APR, max.** is a measure of the annual yield of that pool.\
    **Min. APR** is the minimum profit that a user receives for locking their LP tokens for the shortest period possible.

    **Max. APR** is the profitability for the maximum boost coefficient for LP tokens and the boost for locking QUBE tokens.

    You can find out more about the boosting mechanism via following [this page.](../../concepts/boosted-farming.md)
* **Share** is your share in the farming pool. This is the percentage of the TVL that your locked liquidity constitutes.\
  At the same time, Share also means the percentage of the reward that you will receive for every unit of time.
* **Your reward** is the reward available for the [claim](../../old-farming/how-to/claim-reward.md).
* **Entitled reward** is a reward that is in the [vesting](../../concepts/vesting.md) protocol.
* Notice the **Filters** button at the top right of the page.
