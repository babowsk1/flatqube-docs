# Claim reward

As you go through [**vesting**](../../concepts/vesting.md), your **Entitled reward** is gradually unlocked from the **Unclaimed reward**, from where it can be withdrawn from your Dex account balance at any time.

The amount of Unclaimed tokens can be seen in the [<mark style="background-color:orange;">**Reward balance block**</mark>](../interface/farm-page-user/farming-perfomance-and-balances.md) on the [**farming pool page.**](../interface/farm-page-user/)\
You can withdraw these tokens to your Dex account balance on the same page in the <mark style="color:green;">**Farming balance block**</mark><mark style="color:green;">.</mark>
