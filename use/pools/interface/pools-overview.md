# All pools

By navigating to the **Pools** section, you will find yourself on this page.

Let's take a closer look at it.

In the upper part you will see **Favorite Pools** section.&#x20;

To the right of it there are two buttons: **New position** and **Remove liquidity**, which allow you to [lock or unlock](../how-to/add-liquidity.md) tokens in the pools of your interest.

Lower there is the **All pools** section. It includes the whitelisted pools or those added by yourself. (link to How to - Create/Add custom pair).

The information displayed:

* **The number and the name of the pool** - the name is a set of tokens that make up this pool.
* **TVL** - it is the dollar equivalent of all tokens locked in the respective pool.
* **Volume 24H/7D** - the trading volume of the pool for the last day and a week, respectively.
* **Your share** - your share in this pool. It reflects the percentage of tokens locked by you out of the total number of tokens in this pool.
