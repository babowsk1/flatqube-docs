# Create a new pool

{% hint style="info" %}
You can create your own pool consisting of one or more tokens that are not included in the FlatQube whitelist
{% endhint %}

1. Go to the `Pools` section
2. Click on the `New position` button in the upper right part of the page
3. If your pool will include a token available in the FlatQube whitelist, select it from the list by clicking on `Select a token`. Otherwise, you first need to add a custom token to the list, as described in step `4`.
4. Let's add a token that is not on the list.\
   \
   To do this, click `Select a token` and enter the _Root address_ of the required token in the field at the top of the list. If you created it using the in-built [FlatQube builder](../../token-builder/), you can find the address on the [page of the token](../../token-builder/interface/token-page.md). Also, the root address of any token is displayed on the page of the token in the [EVER Scan](https://everscan.io/) blockchain explorer.\
   \
   Click `Import` and confirm your action.
5. After that, if such a pool has not yet been created on FlatQube, click on the `Create pool` button and confirm the transaction in Ever Wallet.

{% hint style="success" %}
Congratulations! Your pool is created.\
The [process of adding liquidity](add-liquidity.md) to the newly created pool does not differ from the pools located in the FlatQube whitelist.\
You can add it there by placing it in your favorites. \
For this, we need to get to the page of the created pool in the `Pools` section.
{% endhint %}

Please note that at this stage the created pool will not appear on the list of pools!

To do this:

1. Copy the _address of the pool_ (it is displayed at the bottom of the page for adding liquidity), and paste it into the address bar of the `Pools` section (for example, in our case, this is [https://app.flatqube.io/pools/0:e8c3c069c2e2826e1fcbbdbefc489baa230505c675dfe131fe1a57918ac4d3c9](https://app.flatqube.io/pools/0:e8c3c069c2e2826e1fcbbdbefc489baa230505c675dfe131fe1a57918ac4d3c9))
2. Add this pool to your favorites by clicking on the _star_ <img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (101).png" alt="" data-size="line">.
3. Now this pool will be displayed on the main page of the Pools section.
