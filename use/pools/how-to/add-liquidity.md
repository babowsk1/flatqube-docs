# Add liquidity (Get LP tokens) / Withdraw liquidity

## Add liquidity

There are several ways to get to the liquidity deposit interface of a specific pool:

1. Go to the `Pools`section and click on the `New position` in the upper right part of the page.
2. Go to the `Pools` section and then to the page of the pool you are interested in. Then click `Add liquidity` on the upper right side of the page.

Now, let's go directly to the process of adding liquidity:

Learn more about this in the fourth step of the following instructions.

1. Go to the interface for adding liquidity using one of the methods described above.
2. Select the tokens that form the pair of this pool. \
   Note that you can also use tokens not included in the whitelist, thus creating a custom liquidity pool.
3. If you are adding liquidity to this pool for the first time, click on `Connect Pool` and confirm the transaction in the Ever Wallet window that opens.

4. If you are interested in unilateral provision of liquidity, click on `Enable auto-exchange` and enter in the top line the amount of tokens that you want to deposit into the pool. In this case, the equivalent of half of these tokens will be automatically exchanged for the second token of the pair during the deposit process. \
   Otherwise, ignore the auto-exchange and enter the amount of the first and second tokens that you want to deposit into the pool. The equivalent of half of the second token of the pair will be added automatically.
5. Click `Deposit Token 1` and confirm the transaction in the Ever Wallet window that opens.\
   After the transaction is completed, if you have not used auto-exchange, do the same action for the second token.
6. Wait for the token deposit transaction to complete and click Supply. Confirm the transaction in the Ever Wallet window that opens and wait for it to complete.

Congratulations! You have successfully deposited your tokens into the pool. In exchange for the provided liquidity, you will receive LP tokens, which you can then use in the corresponding [farming pool](../../farming/new-farming/interface/farming-pools.md).

## Withdraw liquidity

There are several ways to get to the interface for withdrawing liquidity from a specific pool:

1. Go to the `Pools` section and click on `Remove liquidity` in the upper right part of the page.
2. Go to the `Pools` section and then to the page (link to the Pool page) of the pool you are interested in. Then click `Remove liquidity` on the upper right side of the page.

So, let's go directly to the process of withdrawing liquidity:

1. Select the tokens that form a pair of the pool you are interested in.
2. Enter the amount of LP tokens you want to burn and convert them into “regular” tokens. You will see the number of tokens that will be returned to your balance after the process is completed. Your updated share in the pool and the number of tokens that will remain locked will be displayed at the bottom.
3. Click `Confirm` and confirm the transaction in the Ever Wallet window that opens.
4. After confirming the transaction, just wait for its completion. Once it is completed, you will see the Transaction submitted window.&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
Congratulations! The tokens have been added to your balance.
