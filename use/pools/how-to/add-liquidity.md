# Add liquidity

Please note that this section assumes that you have already provided liquidity to the required pool. Otherwise, the process will be different - go to the [**new position page**](create-new-position.md).

## Simple liquidity provision

To add tokens to an existing position, go to the [Pools section](../), then go to the [page of the desired pool](../interface/pool-page/) by clicking on the appropriate pair and clicking <mark style="color:red;">**Add Liquidity**</mark>.

After that, you will be taken to the page for adding liquidity to the pool.

On this page, you can add liquidty to the pool of this pair.\
\
Recall that you do not need to have both tokens in equal proportion on your balance, since FlatQube has an automatic exchange function that allows you to provide [**one-sided liquidity**](add-liquidity.md#one-sided-liquidity-provision).

#### Adding liquidity (using the WEVER/USDC pair as an example)

To get started, enter the amount of tokens you wish to **add to the pool**.\
You can enter the amount of either the left or right tokens, and the required amount of the second token will be calculated automatically at the current FlatQube rate.

After entering the amount, you will see how much your [**Pool share**](../pool-economics.md) will change, as well as the ratio of the price of tokens.

Now you need to deposit tokens. Click Deposit and confirm the transaction in EVER Wallet.

After a successful deposit of the left token, do the same for the right one:

And here we are almost at the finish line - now it is necessary to produce **Supply**.\
This operation will also require confirmation.

After you successfully complete the Supply process, you will see a **Supply receipt window.**

Here you will see the current **Pool share** and the percentage by which it was increased by this transaction, as well as the number of received [**LP tokens.**](calculate-the-amount-of-lp-tokens.md)

## One-sided liquidity provision

FlatQube has an automatic exchange feature that also allows you to provide one-way liquidity.

In order to provide liquidity using only one of the tokens, enable **Auto Exchange** and enter the amount of one of the tokens.

The next steps you need to take are identical to those in the [**first example**](add-liquidity.md#adding-liquidity-on-the-example-of-the-wever-usdc-pair), the only difference being that after depositing the token, you will immediately be taken to **Supply**.

After you successfully complete the Supply process, you will see a **Supply receipt window.**

Here you will see the current **Pool share** and the percentage by which it was increased by this transaction, as well as the number of received [**LP tokens.**](calculate-the-amount-of-lp-tokens.md)
