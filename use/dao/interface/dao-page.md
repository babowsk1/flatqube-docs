# DAO page

Welcome to the [FlatQube DAO homepage](https://app.flatqube.io/dao).

Here you can find the main statistics, current and past epochs, as well as a list of farming pools, so-called **candidates**.

Also, this is the starting point for navigating to other pages of the Flatqube DAO, such as [**Epochs** ](epoch.md)or [**Balance**](dao-balance.md).

Let's take a closer look at all the elements here.

At the top of the page, general statistics is provided:

* **Total QUBEs locked** - displays the number of QUBEs locked in the QUBE DAO contract.
* **Total veQUBE** - the total number of veQUBEs.
* **Average locktime** - the average time for which QUBE tokens are locked.
* **Percentage of total QUBE supply** - the percentage of the total QUBEs issued. You can see the total supply issued here.

Below you can see the **Epochs** block. It displays the following information:

* The current **date** and **status** of the epoch, as well as subsequent statuses and the time of their beginning and end.
* **Distribution** - the total number of QUBE tokens for distribution.
* **Voted of total veQube** - the number of veQUBE tokens that voted.
* **Total pools number** - the number of pools participating in the voting.
* **Min weight** - the minimum number of votes required to get into the distribution of awards.
* **Max weight** - the maximum number of votes for one pool.

In the center of the block, you can see a graphical representation of the distribution of votes by currency pairs.

* Current **Status** of the pool
* **TVL** - the total number of dollars locked in the pool.
* **Average voting rate** - the average percentage of tokens used by participants to vote for a candidate out of the total number of veQUBE used in the voting.
* **Last epoch voting rate** - the percentage of veQUBE cast by voting participants to vote for a candidate out of the total number of veQUBE used for voting in the previous epoch.
