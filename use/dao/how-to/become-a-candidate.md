# Become a candidate

You can add your own (and not only) pool to the next era using the Add Candidate interface.&#x20;

The cost of adding a candidate is 1000 QUBE.

After adding a candidate, it will appear in the next epoch.&#x20;

However, if within four epochs (8 weeks) this candidate does not reach the minimum number of votes (1%), this candidate will be removed from voting in further epochs.

So, let's look at how to add your own candidate:

1. Go to the DAO section and go down to the Candidates block.
2. Click on Become a candidate at the top right of the block to open the add candidate interface.

3\. Enter the address of the farming pool you want to add as a candidate in the corresponding field and click Become a candidate. Confirm the transaction in the Ever Wallet window that opens.

4\. Congratulations! This candidate will be on the voting in the next epoch.
