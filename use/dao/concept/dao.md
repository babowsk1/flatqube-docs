# DAO

## What is DAO?

The DEX is getting bigger, with more liquidity, users, and responsibilities. The time has come to move further: to make operations even more transparent, increase our technological capabilities, and provide users with the ability to earn even more.

We launched the DAO so that the management of earning mechanisms on the platform would be in the hands of our users, liquidity providers, and QUBE holders!

## Main functionality

* Voting for token distribution&#x20;
* Voting for changes to the DEX itself, including new token listings

Voting takes place using veQUBE tokens.
