# Epoch

## What's this?

An epoch is a period of time when voting for reward distribution takes place.

## **Stages**

At the DAO’s launch, one epoch consists of three stages:&#x20;

1. Awaiting – 2 days&#x20;
2. Voting – 11 days&#x20;
3. Queued – 1 day

The stages, their number, and their length may change according to the decision of the DAO.

## Which QUBE tokens get distributed?

In the QUBE tokenomics, 70% of tokens are allocated for farming. Initially, the Broxus team managed the farming speed itself. Now, this is done by QUBE token holders.

## What happens to veQUBE after voting ends?

After voting ends, when the “Queued” stage finishes, your veQUBE are returned to your virtual balance.
