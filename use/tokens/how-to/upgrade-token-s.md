# Upgrade token(s)

If you have obsolete tokens in your EVER wallet (for example, TIP-3), then when you [connect your wallet](../../getting-started/how-to-connect-a-wallet.md) to FlatQube (or just open FlatQube if the wallet was connected earlier), you will automatically receive an offer to update them.

Let's go through all the steps to upgrade tokens:

Click **Upgrade** to start the token upgrade process.

At this point, an EVER Wallet window will open, where you will need to confirm the transaction.\
\
Click **Send**, and in the next step, enter the password for the wallet account and click **Confirm transaction**.

Upon completion of the upgrade, you will receive a notification from EVER Wallet about the crediting of the corresponding updated token.\
The transaction itself can be found in the list of transactions in the wallet:
