# Use limit trading

This page provides a step-by-step guide on how to utilize Limit Trading on FlatQube. Follow these instructions to make the most of this feature:

## Creating a Limit Order

1. Navigate to the `Swap` section of FlatQube.
2. In the swap window on the right-hand side, select the `Limit` option.
3. Choose the tokens you wish to trade, specifying the token pair for your limit order.
4. Now, you have two options to determine your trade: by `amount` or by `price`. If you click the lock icon and set the amount for both tokens, the DEX will automatically calculate the price based on the entered amounts. Alternatively, if you close the lock icon and set a specific price for the trade, the DEX will calculate the second token amount automatically based on the price you've set. You can also use the `Market Price` button to set the price according to the current market value.
5. Once you have completed the above steps, click the `Make an Order` button and confirm the transaction. Your order will be placed on the blockchain and will appear in the `My Orders` section.
6. Click `Make an Order`, then `Confirm`, and approve the transaction in the opened Ever Wallet window.

After placing your limit order, you will need to wait for its execution. To learn more about how orders are executed and the concepts behind it, please refer to the [`Concept page`](../concepts/limit-orders.md).
